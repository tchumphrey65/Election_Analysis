# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado board of elections employee assigned us the task of completing an election audit of a recent local congressional election.  We will use a python program to analyze the data and determine the winner of the election.  The program will also analyze the counties, report total votes, percentages and the county with the highest turnout.  The summary of results requested are listed below.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.
2. Compile a complete list of all counties where ballots were cast.
3. Calculate the total number of votes and the percentage of the total votes cast for each county.
4. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.
5. Compile a complete list of all candidates receiving votes.
6. Calculate the total number of votes received by each candidate.
7. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidae.
8. Determine the winner of the Election.
9. The results must be printer to the terminal
10. The results must be output to a text file

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, PyCharm 2021.3 (Community Edition)

## Summary
The Analysis of the Election data shows the following:

----------------------------
- Total Votes Cast: 369,711
----------------------------
Counties in the election were
1. Jefferson
2. Denver
3. Arapahoe

Results by county are:
1. Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
2. Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
3. Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

---------------------------------
- Largest County Turnout: Denver
---------------------------------

The Candidates were:
  1. Charles Casper Stockham
  2. Diana DeGette
  3. Raymon Anthony Doane

THe Individual Candidate vote totals and percentages were:
  1. Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  2. Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  3. Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The Winner of the Election was:
  - Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes equal to 73.8% of total votes cast.

Note:  This election analysis program could be applied to any election resutls and is capable of interpreteing the results of any counnty election provided the results can be supplied in the comma seperated variable data format as the original project request.  There are other enhancement that could enhance user interface, provide options to analyze another election with the capability for a user to provide a link to the file path.  There are also additional data analysis opportunites that would include the percentage of votes each candidate recieved in each county. 

## Challenge Summary
I was able to complete the code as required, deliver the requested analysis by the client and learned some of the basics of using python.  I am continuing to learn how to reference lists and dictionaries in python.  I do feel that I gained some confidence coding with this assignment.  Next steps for me is understanding and integrating the join.os capability to improve my sill in linking to data files more cleanly.
